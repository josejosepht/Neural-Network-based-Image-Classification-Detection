# Neural-Network-based-Image-Classification-Detection
This Jupyter notebook implements AlexNet, modifies the network for smaller images, implements BasicBlock for ResNet18/34, explores data augmentations for generalization, analyzes downsampling/upsampling, and evaluates overfitting using train/validation losses in TensorBoard | Transformers, data augmentation, model evaluation.
